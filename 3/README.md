https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-conditional-statements

##Objective 

In this challenge, we're getting started with conditional statements. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

##Task 

Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20 , print Not Weird

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.

##Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, .

## Output Format

Constraints

i <= n <= 10

## Output Format

Print  if the number is weird; otherwise, print .

## Sample Input 0

3

## Sample Output 0

Weird

## Sample Input 1

24

## Sample Output 1

Not Weird

## Explanation

Sample Case 0:  
n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird

Sample Case 1:  
n  and n is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird
