Objective 

Welcome to the last day! Today, we're discussing bitwise operations. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task 

Given set S. Find two integers, A and B (where A < B), from set S such that the value of A&B is the maximum possible and also less than a given integer, K. In this case,  & represents the bitwise AND operator.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases. 
Each of the T subsequent lines defines a test case as 2 space-separated integers, N and K, respectively.

Constraints

Output Format

For each test case, print the maximum possible value of  on a new line.
