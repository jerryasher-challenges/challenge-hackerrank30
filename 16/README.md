Objective 
Today, we're getting started with Exceptions by learning how to parse an integer from a string and print a custom error message. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task 
Read a string, S, and print its integer value; if S cannot be converted to an integer, print Bad String.
